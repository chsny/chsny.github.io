I am a post-doctoral researcher in **Metal Additive Manufacturing** and **Machine Learning** at the department of Mechanical Engineering of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Brussels, Belgium. My research focuses on optimizing the Directed Energy Deposition process by applying Machine Learning techniques on *in-situ* monitoring data. 

I received my Master's degree in Electromechanical Engineering from [Universit√© Catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en) in 2016 and successfully defended my PhD at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/en/) in 2024. Before working in academia, I worked in the aerospace sector, at [Safran Aero Boosters](https://www.safran-group.com/companies/safran-aero-boosters) as a R&T Engineer and at the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) as a National Trainee. 

# Research interests
 - Optimization of the steady-state Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process using temperature estimation and Machine Learning methods
 - Deep Learning anomaly detection in DED using in-situ hyperspectral melt pool images
 - Reinforcement Learning control of the DED process
