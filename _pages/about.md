I am a PhD researcher in Metal Additive Manufacturing at the department of Mechanical Engineering of the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/en/) in Brussels, Belgium. My research focuses on optimizing the Directed Energy Deposition process by applying Machine Learning techniques on *in-situ* monitoring data. 

I received my Master's degree in Electromechanical Engineering from [Universit√© Catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en) in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. Before starting my PhD, I worked in the aerospace sector, at Safran Aero Boosters as a R&T Engineer and at the European Space Agency as a National Trainee.
